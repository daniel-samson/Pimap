### Rationale
When communication with an IMAP email server involves a high amount of latency,
it helps to be able to hand craft commands, so that we can reduce the quantity of commands being sent to the server. The PHP IMAP extension
does not offer such control of over the transport layer of the IMAP protocol. This library replaces the PHP IMAP extension
and provides full control over the entire process.

### Features
- Fewer combined calls
- Decrease latency
- Command builder
- IMAP Connection Manager 
- IMAP Response Interpreters
- Pipeline for caching commands and responses
- PSR 3 logger aware
- Mock objects for automated testing

### Compliant
- [RFC 3501](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501) IMAP version 4rev1
- [RFC 2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822) Internet Message Format
- [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

### Add to your project (Composer)

```bash

```

### Getting Help
All of the documentation is situated in the [docs](https://github.com/daniel-samson/Pimap/tree/master/docs/en) directory. I recommend that you look at the [Getting Started](https://github.com/daniel-samson/Pimap/blob/master/docs/en/01_Getting_Started.md) page. The documentation in this project is written in mark down and generated using [Daux.io](https://daux.io/).

#### Generate Documentation
To build the documentation

```bash
cd /path/to/pimap/
./vendor/bin/daux
```

open the generated _static/index.html_ file.

#### Host Documentation
When updating the documentation, it helps to be able to see a live copy of your changes. Daux.io provides a built in web server.

```bash
cd /path/to/pimap/
./vendor/bin/daux serve
```

this command will output something similar to:
```bash
Daux development server started on http://localhost:8085/
```

in this case you can access  **http://localhost:8085/** in your web browser.
